# EGU 2020-2024 Abstract embeddings and semantic search

This repository contains code and data for the preprint ["GC Insights: Breaking the silos â€“ leveraging NLP to encourage interdisciplinary interaction at the EGU"](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3430/)

__Abstract__
Thousands of abstracts from various geoscience sub-fields are presented annually at the EGU General Assembly (GA), offering a rich resource for tracking scientific progress. However, rigid session groupings can limit cross-disciplinary exploration. Here, we show that participants focusing only on their broad disciplinary session miss an average of 44 % of the 10 most relevant contributions. To break this compartmentalization, we propose using natural language processing (NLP), enabling the geoscience community to explore the full breadth of knowledge beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.

The attached Python notebook holds all necessary scripts to replicate the research. The embeddings and text data are available upon request via email from Jan Sodoge (see email in pre-print).
